# Probabilistic-Roadmaps
Python implementation of PRM algoritm. 

When you run the program, it will ask you to enter the workspace obstacles
Follow the on screen instruction to do the same (it's real fun!)

Start has been already defined in code as (0,0)
Goal has been already defined in code as (10,0)

To change the Coordinates of Start and Goal, please make the change in code itself (line 159 and line 160)

Next, the code will ask you to enter number of samples, radius for neighbors, xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax.

Once all the information hass been entered, the code will output a visual display of the solution,
showing the path from start to goal.
